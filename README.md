## Purpose

To enable NuGet integration in vim.

## Installation

Install using your favourite plugin manager,
I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```viml
Plug 'markwoodhall/vim-nuget'
```

## Requirements

vim-nuget makes use of [vim-webapi](https://github.com/mattn/webapi-vim), [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim), and [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim).

```viml
Plug 'mattn/webapi-vim'
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
Plug 'Shougo/deoplete.nvim'
```

## Configuration

If you have [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) installed and wish to use it for asynchronous package installations you can use the following setting:

```viml
let g:nuget_install_with_neomake = 1
```

## Commands

```viml
:SearchPackages query
```

`:SearchPackages` shows a list of packages matching the `query` and then allows version selection. After a version has been selected
the package information will be displayed in a markdown buffer. This buffer has `I` bound to install the package and `F` bound to follow dependencies.    

```viml
:InstallPackage package "tab completion is available on the package name.
```

```viml
:RemovePackage package "tab completion is available on the package name.
```

```viml
:PackageInfo package "tab completion is available on the package name.
```
![package-info](http://i.imgur.com/wedleIm.gif)

`:PackageInfo` shows a list of versions for the package. After a version has been selected
the package information will be displayed in a markdown buffer. This buffer has `I` bound to install the package and `F` bound to follow dependencies.    

## Completion

You can also get package name and version completion in `.csproj` files.
